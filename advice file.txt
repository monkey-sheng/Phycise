#GeneralLevel1#You have a lot of room for improvements! I wonder if you even remember the face of your Physics teacher.
Allocate more time to you Physics study,and you will surely make progress.#GeneralLevel1#
#GeneralLevel2#Honestly speaking, you didn't do a good job...at least in this quiz.Hopefully this is just a rare case, 
or an accident. Put your heart on it and you will find Physics easy to learn.#GeneralLevel2#
#GeneralLevel3#You have done ok in Physics generally, but still room to improve.If you are not working hard enough,
then work harder! At least 5 hours must be spent on Physics every week,if you want to be outstanding in this subject.#GeneralLevel3#
#GeneralLevel4#You have done a good job overall! Seems that you have a basic concept of every topic in the quiz here.
There are a few mistakes, however. So if you want to be exceptionally good at Physics, make sure your understanding is beyond basic concepts.#GeneralLevel4#
#GeneralLevel5#Only one mistake out of 15 questions! Excellent job! You must be very good at Physics, right?
Check out how you made that only mistake, and try to avoid reoccurance. Keep up the good work!#GeneralLevel5#
#GeneralLevel6#Not a single mistake! You must have worked very hard on Physics...or you are just too gifted? Hopefully both lol;)
Anyways, You are simply too good, so my only advice is: Keep calm and carry on.lol.#GeneralLevel6#
#Units#Units should probably be the easiest topics in Physics. Keep in mind the approach to derive units,
memorize the units for often-used quantities, then it should not be difficult anymore.#Units#
#Vector#Well, vector is part of Maths, so I suggest that you go back to your Maths textbook and review everything again.
Memorizing what quantity is vector and what is scaler is crucial in doing MCQs.
You must also familiarize yourself with vector calculations--not to be confused with scaler calculations!#Vector#
#Motion#Can you recall all 4 suvat formulae of motion right now? I really doubt that you can.Good news if you can though.
It is very improtant that you remember the formulae, and only by familiarizing yourself with them can you find the correct approach
in a quiz or an exam.#Motion#
#Graph Interpretation#Dealing with graphs can be quite hard since it may invovle multiple topics in just one graph,
and finding information in a graph is usually harder than that in plain English.Remember, approach a graph by first looking at
its axes label, then gradient, then area under the curve.This often leads to a breakthorugh.#Graph Interpretation#
#Acceleration#Acceleration should not be harder than motion, just be aware that it is a vector and choose the proper formular from
the 4 suvat formulae.#Acceleration#
#Energy#When dealing with energy, how to calculate energy produced should be easy, simply choose formular according to
what quantity is provided in the question.Always remember the law of conservation of energy, you will need it now and then to
find out how energy is transformed.#Energy#
#Material#In the topic of material, you should remember every property in detail, because what will be asked is detailed.
You will have to work on these alone and nobody can help you remember it if you doun't memorize it yourself.#Material#
#Waves#Waves come in different forms, sound, light, elctromagnetic,etc.But remember they share the same nature.
They all have period, amplitude,and their speed equals to frequency multiplied by wave length.Note that C.R.O is different,
pay special attention to its graph interpretation.#Waves#
#Electric#Electric is one of the most difficult part in Physics.First of all, make sure you understand the circuit diagram,
and then do citcuit analysis based on correct understandings.You'll find it easier to apply all the laws once you understand
the diagram.Redrawing is a common approach, and tracing how the current goes helps a lot.#Electric#
#Particles#Particles...well, they involve quite a lot of topics: momentum, elctric, pressure,etc.The only difference,perhaps,
is that some properties are implied,like the mass of ¦Á-particle, the electric charge of electrons,etc.
Make sure you remember and apply them.#Particles#
